Terra Classic is a delegated proof-of-stake network powered by LUNC. Validators produce blocks, delegators secure the network through staking, and governance directs protocol evolution.

Staking rewards derive from gas fees, swaps, and the burn tax. Hardware wallet support is recommended for critical accounts to preserve key hygiene.

This section of the documentation provides an overview of Terra Classic and its key components.
