> Terra Classic adopts the Cosmos SDK `x/consensus` module to manage Tendermint/CometBFT consensus parameters through governance. The module stores the active block, evidence, and validator parameter sets and exposes a single governance-controlled message to mutate them. Please see the upstream specification for [x/consensus](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/modules/consensus/) for more details.
