## Overview

A smart contract is a contract whose terms are expressed as a computer program with logic and state persisted on the blockchain. Smart contracts can automatically carry out its terms and conditions with total transparency and no counter-party risk.

Smart contracts allow users to extend the capabilities of the Terra Classic blockchain by introducing custom logic that can be composed against the Terra Classic blockchain's financial primitives such as its native tokens, oracle price feed, and others. These decentralized applications unlock new avenues of value-transfer through enabling unique transaction flows not provided by Terra Classic's native modules.

## Developer tools

The following table maps commonly-used Ethereum developer tools to their Terra counterparts.

## Why build on Terra Classic?

### Robust consensus and fast block finality

Terra Classic is powered by Tendermint BFT consensus, using a dPoS-like scheme driven by a set of validators. This efficient consensus model enables batches of transactions to occur in only 6 seconds (only a fraction of the time it takes for Bitcoin and Ethereum).

### Ready for DeFi applications

With fundamental infrastructure such as price oracles, community governance and automated monetary and fiscal policy, Terra Classic acts as its own autonomous sovereign economy driven by its users, its projects, and provides all the necessary incentive mechanics and modular plumbing to power modern DeFi smart contracts.

### Active user base with real-world usage

With highly active users from a variety of integrations, the Terra Classic economy is a thriving new home for the future of innovative products.

### Community-owned

Terra Classic is a community-owned project, it is not owned by any single entity.
